NES Protractor 
==========

[Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor) is an end-to-end test framework for applications built with frameworks like [Angular](http://angular.io/), [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) and more. 

Protractor is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) program built on top of [WebDriverJS](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs). Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.

Protractor reached End Of Life in August 2023, with [HeroDevs](https://www.herodevs.com) extending support for an additional year through it's [Never Ending Support](https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-protractor) OSS Support initiative. Contact HeroDevs to learn more. 

Compatibility
-------------

Protractor 7 is compatible with Nodejs v10, v12, and newer.

Protractor works with AngularJS versions greater than 1.0.6/1.1.4, and is compatible with Angular applications. Note that for Angular apps, the `binding` and `model` locators are not supported. We recommend using `by.css`.
